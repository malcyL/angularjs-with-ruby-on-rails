#AngularJS with Rails

This repo is my walkthrough of the tutorial: [AngularJS with Ruby on Rails](http://angular-rails.com) by David Bryant Copeland.

It creates a Rails backend with an AngularJS frontend, and most importantly, shows how to test both. It's a great tutorial if your looking for a way to use AngularJS with Rails.
